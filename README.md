1. ⁠Make a CMS (Content Management System) page with login and user management
2. ⁠each user has authorization for each role (example: user A can only view blog, user B can view and edit a blog)
3. ⁠use your preferable stack for this project (laravel, express, react, etc)
4. ⁠Add first menu into the CMS a cron job to do a currency converter IDR to USD every 12 hours (freecurrencyapi.com)
5. ⁠add second menu a currency converter with a good user friendly

Please make sure you : 
1. ⁠Please break down the project into 3-4 milestones, and create a PR for each. Please do this first thing! Each PR will be on it’s own branch, e.g. Release 1, Release 2 etc. Or preferably you can give them meaningful names.
2. ⁠When you’re done with a milestone, squash merge it into the next PR. E.g. you’re done with release1, squash merge release1 into release2. From that point on please continue working on release2. Don’t go back to release1 and change it! Any bugs you would like to fix, simply fix them in release2. Once it’s done, squash merge it into release3 etc…
3. ⁠Please keep all your branches and PRs, no need to delete anything
4. ⁠Merge the final release into master
5. ⁠⁠Please include few screenshot or screen recording of the final result. Sometimes I need to make sure that what I see on my end is similar to what you're getting.
